# bolt

First of all, I am not very good at jokes. You will understand what I mean ;)

The goal of this project is to create a tool that:
- automate the execution of a program using several arguments
- measure the program execution
- evaluate the program execution

Basically, this project is a program runner. And the best runner I know is Usain Bolt. I told you, I am not good at jokes ;)
